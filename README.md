# VirusSpread
The code allows the user to input a list of people along with friends associated to each individual, then the user has to give various inputs like meeting possibility, health of infected person and number of days of simulation. Based on the inputs given by the user the code calculates the spread of virus amongst the population on the basis of health of infected person and meeting probability.
The sample set shows how the data should be provided to the code.
The file reading_population reads the data set and creates the object of each individual in the dataset.
The file health_calculation calculates the health of each individual after meeting the infected individual and gaining health after resting at night.
The graph file simulates the spread of virus in the population over a given simulated number of days.
